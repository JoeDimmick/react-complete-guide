When updating state based on the value of the current (or old state). The best way to to do it is to pass a function to the setState call.

example.

given const [ isEditing, setIsEditing ] = useState(false);

instead of doing
setIsEditing(!isEditing);

you should pass a function to your state updating function. This function will automatically be called by react and will receive the
guaranteed latest state value.

setIsEditiing(wasEditing => !wasEditing);

The problem with setIsEditing(!isEditing); react is scheduling state updates, it is not performed immidately it is scheduled for the future.
this could cause the value of !isEditing to not be the value you may expect.
